FISHv4th_OEM goals:
  BIG PSTAT version.
  allways use .h files for this type of notes, just don't include em~!
    
    NEED TO redo Wordcat / word adding process.
      for now #define WORDS_START as the definative method.
        New words and wordcats are the beneficiaries~!
          
    SIMPLIFY THIS CRAP for any pro/commercial wordset you develop~!
      Craft it inline as a tool~!

EXPECT_FILE ( --) Simple high speed expect

GPIO Wordcat: 1rst whack will be pstat specific
MAKE all needed WORDCATS and define insertion of words in the cat~!
We want the 1rs whack to be them made our OEM version
and then make BIG PSTAT a branch of that we just tear off for BIG.

  Chip_Select_ADC ( on=!0/off-0 -- <signal is active low>),
  DAC, etc for test and production.
    Smartio_LED ( on=!0/off-0 -- )

Tread carefully~!!!
I made a few too many shortcuts in FISH.
The following goals may have issues with my implementation:

Cache TOS and NOS: I hope this isn't a bear~!

VIC: I need help getting the hi-level single stepping working,
      and IAR debugging best practices~!
