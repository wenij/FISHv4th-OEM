Should an error processed by EHON, ater its has gotten CO do a EHOFF?

Fixes in versions comments:
I have redone a clone of the FISHv4th-OEM branch v1.8x,
which has none of the PSTAT work.
I didn't understand that COMMIT affect my local repo's .git folder,
not the repository. My local commits must be PUSH'd~!
So I saved the old repo and will repopulate from there with care~!

FIRST~!:
Verifying all files match (old LOCAL repo and new clone)
IN THE big-pstat branch I cloned.
FISHv4th-OEM_branch_BIG-PSTAT in my Desktop.
It is not where my copied directory of the last good is...
Using Dev ant's Code Compare.


Code Compare tool rocks~!

Suggestions:
FUART_BRR_BAUD  //where FUART denotes FISH word vs user UART words.
