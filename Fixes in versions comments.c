/*
Fixes in versions comments:
I have redone a clone of the FISHv4th-OEM branch v1.8x,
which has none of the PSTAT work.
I didn't understand that COMMIT affect my local repo's .git folder,
not the repository. My local commits must be PUSH'd~!
So I saved the old repo and will repopulate from there with care~!

FIRST~!:
Verifying all files match (old LOCAL repo and new clone)
 - from explorer view of this project):
	core_cm3.h


Code Compare tool rocks~!

Suggestions:
FUART_BRR_BAUD  //where FUART denotes FISH word vs user UART words.
