Fixes in versions comments:

This FISH v1.7.2 runs.
  3BS issue~!
    !!!! It's when you bs 1 more than needed~!
      From 1 character on up.
        TIB BS routines need scrutiny~!

That Fish v1.6 runs fine

Code Compare tool rocks~!

C:\Users\Clyde W Phillips Jr\Desktop\FISH-v1.72\FISH_STM32F4_UART3_INIT.s
//UART3_INIT: should be renamed.
//It sets baud rates for the UART's BRR register
//and programs the BRR, determined by system vars DBAUD and UBAUD or a user
//supplied decimal baud rate value.

Suggestions:
FUART_BRR_BAUD  //where FUART denotes FISH word vs user UART words.
