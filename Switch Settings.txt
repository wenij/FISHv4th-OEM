SWITCH MATRIX
Voltage as measured on J1 (Sensor Header) Pin2 = CE

SW1 ON CONNECTS DAC-OUT TO CE (WITH SW2 OFF)
SW1 OFF DISCONNECTS CE FROM THE DAC-OUT

SW2 ON ROUTES ADC-RE THRU TO ADC-DAC-RE
SW2 OFF LEAVES ADC-RE CONNECTED TO RE

SW3 ON ADDS ADC-RE TO DAC-OUT AND IS GATED BY SW1 TO CE
SW3 OFF

SW4 ON ROUTES WE TO ADC-WE THRU THE GAIN SWITCH MATRIX
  - ADC Reset is non differential input into AIN0 with AIN 1 grounded.
  - A default power test can be derived.
SW4 OFF WE IS NOT CONNECTED THRU THE GAIN SWITCH MATRIX


ALL ON  = 4.96v (vRef) DAC-RAMP TO ZERO, DACW VALUES WORK
ALL OFF = GROUND


SW1 ON ONLY = 5.00v   SW4 CAN BE ON ALSO  DAC-RAMP HAS NO EFFECT UNTIL SW3 ON
SW2 ON ONLY = 0.00v
SW3 ON ONLY = 0.00v
SW4 ON ONLY = 0.00v
